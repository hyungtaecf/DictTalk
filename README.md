The ultimate goal of this project is to make an application that people who are learning languages can have an open dictionary to improve their knowledge about the words. Through this application people can learn, teach, leave a comment, discuss about, up vote and down vote everything, see synonyms and antonyms of the words, make list of words and study the words later offline. Other people can access your public lists through your profile and clone them to their lists. There is also a hashtags system, where you can use keywords to classify them by grammar class, etymology, and so on. However just the first stage of the project is complete.
